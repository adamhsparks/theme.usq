# usq.theme

The goal of usq.theme is to provide USQ staff and students with an easy to use
_ggplot2_ theme that conforms to the USQ visual guidelines for typography and
colour.

## Example

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
library("theme.usq")

p <- ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(
    x = wt,
    y = mpg,
    colour = factor(gear)
  )) +
  facet_wrap( ~ am)

p + theme_usq()
```
